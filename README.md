Hi :D

The reason why the price isn't added to this database, is that price change is common for tech pieces and I cant keep up with the price changes.

If an error message shows up due to a not installed Colorama, go to cmd and type "pip install colorama" and wait for it to install.

No, your username and passswords are NOT stored in cloud cus I don't know how to do it(yet).

Ignore the "memory.db" file, dont know why its there and cant seem to delete it
